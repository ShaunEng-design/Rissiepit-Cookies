            <p>Hi, I’m Risani – an ex-hairstylist, ex-finance/admin assistant, ex-nail technician, ex-makeup artist, ex-personal assistant, and ex-manager. 
                Life led me to decorate my very first set of cowgirl royal icing cookies almost 7 years ago. And let’s just say, I was hooked!</p>
                <br>
                <p>I’ve been so blessed that I could stop working and focus solely on my art. Yes, it is art. I don’t believe in copying from a machine. 
                    Every cookie I make is handmade, hand-drawn, hand-painted, and hand-decorated. I’ve been told by clients who know my work that they can immediately 
                    tell when my cookies are at an event because they’re not overly thick — that’s one of my trademarks.</p>
                <p>And then, of course, the biggest joke I have is my new slogan: “If it’s not late, it’s not made by me.” I simply can’t say no to clients, and that always 
                    gets me into trouble with my timing. I end up working long hours, at least four nights a week, with Thursdays and Fridays usually being my all-nighters to 
                    get all the orders done in time for events. You’ll often catch me in my “all-nighter outfit” (just my way of referring to my PJs) because, trust me, they’re 
                    the best for late-night work!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Over the years, I’ve added a few new products, like the Rizzi — my 8cm mini cake. And yes, I do have a family: a wonderful husband, </p>
                <p>an 8-year-old daughter 
                    (who’s going on 18), and a 7-year-old son who’s in Grade 1. So, just like any other mom, </p>
                <p>I juggle school projects, school runs, and homework. 
                    Add in cricket, rugby, music lessons, choir… </p>
                <p>and the list goes on and on.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>I totally get those Spider-Man, Minecraft, Fortnite, Mermaid, Disney Princesses, and Encanto orders!</p>
